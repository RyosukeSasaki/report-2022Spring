	abstract = {The purpose of this article is to review the current status of a frontier in dynamic spintronics and contemporary magnetism, in which much progress has been made in the past decade, based on the creation of a variety of micro and nanostructured devices that enable electrical detection of magnetization dynamics. The primary focus is on the physics of spin rectification effects, which are well suited for studying magnetization dynamics and spin transport in a variety of magnetic materials and spintronic devices. Intended to be intelligible to a broad audience, the paper begins with a pedagogical introduction, comparing the methods of electrical detection of charge and spin dynamics in semiconductors and magnetic materials respectively. After that it provides a comprehensive account of the theoretical study of both the angular dependence and line shape of electrically detected ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), which is summarized in a handbook format easy to be used for analysing experimental data. We then review and examine the similarity and differences of various spin rectification effects found in ferromagnetic films, magnetic bilayers and magnetic tunnel junctions, including a discussion of how to properly distinguish spin rectification from the spin pumping/inverse spin Hall effect generated voltage. After this we review the broad applications of rectification effects for studying spin waves, nonlinear dynamics, domain wall dynamics, spin current, and microwave imaging. We also discuss spin rectification in ferromagnetic semiconductors. The paper concludes with both historical and future perspectives, by summarizing and comparing three generations of FMR spectroscopy which have been developed for studying magnetization dynamics.},

	abstract = {Mechanical rotation of a crystal lattice in ferromagnetic materials can be energetically coupled with its magnetization via magnetoelastic coupling or spin rotation coupling. Surface acoustic wave (SAW) in piezoelectric materials is one of the promising candidates to realize the mechanical excitation of magnetization dynamics. In order to understand the mechanical rotation induced magnetization dynamics quantitatively, we examined the ferromagnetic resonance in a Ni film using a SAW in a LiNbO3 substrate. By decreasing a period of interdigital transducer as short as 4 μm which is one-fifth of the previous work by Weiler [M. Weiler et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 117601 (2011)], the fundamental frequency of SAW could be higher than 800 MHz. From the dependence of microwave absorption on the angle between the magnetization and the wave vector of SAW, it was confirmed that the Rayleigh type SAW, which was significant to obtain a large mechanical coupling with the magnetization, was dominantly excited in the 800-MHz-SAW device.},

	abstract = {The spin Seebeck effect refers to the generation of a spin voltage caused by a temperature gradient in a ferromagnet, which enables the thermal injection of spin currents from the ferromagnet into an attached nonmagnetic metal over a macroscopic scale of several millimeters. The inverse spin Hall effect converts the injected spin current into a transverse charge voltage, thereby producing electromotive force as in the conventional charge Seebeck device. Recent theoretical and experimental efforts have shown that the magnon and phonon degrees of freedom play crucial roles in the spin Seebeck effect. In this paper, we present the theoretical basis for understanding the spin Seebeck effect and brieﬂy discuss other thermal spin effects.},
